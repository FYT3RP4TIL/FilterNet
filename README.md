# üìß FilterNet : Pinpoint Email Spam Detection

## üîç Overview
FilterNet is an advanced machine learning project designed to classify email messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). Utilizing state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier, FilterNet provides a robust solution for email filtering.

## ‚ú® Features
- üìä Efficient data preprocessing and analysis
- üî§ Advanced text vectorization using Bag of Words model
- üß† Naive Bayes classification for optimal spam detection
- üìà Comprehensive model evaluation and visualization
- üöÄ Scalable pipeline for streamlined workflow

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Dataset: `spam.csv`
- Features: 'Message' (text) and 'Category' (spam/ham)
- Binary 'spam' column: 1 for spam, 0 for ham

### 2. Text Vectorization: Bag of Words
FilterNet employs the Bag of Words model for text-to-numerical feature conversion:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
v = CountVectorizer()
X_train_cv = v.fit_transform(X_train.values)
```

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple and intuitive approach
  - Preserves word frequency information
- **Limitations**:
  - Loses word order context
  - Can result in large, sparse matrices

### 3. Classification Model: Naive Bayes
FilterNet utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier:

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
model = MultinomialNB()
```

- **Why Naive Bayes for FilterNet?**
  - Highly effective for text classification tasks
  - Performs well with high-dimensional data
  - Fast training and prediction capabilities
  - Efficient with relatively small datasets

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes in FilterNet**:
  - Tailored for discrete features (e.g., word counts)
  - Assumes features follow a simple multinomial distribution

### 4. FilterNet Pipeline
FilterNet leverages scikit-learn's Pipeline for a streamlined workflow:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
clf = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('nb', MultinomialNB())
])
```

- **Benefits of FilterNet's Pipeline**:
  - Encapsulates multiple steps in a single, coherent object
  - Prevents data leakage during cross-validation
  - Simplifies application of consistent steps to training and test data

### 5. Model Evaluation in FilterNet
FilterNet employs various metrics for comprehensive model evaluation:

1. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
2. **ROC Curve**: Plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate.
3. **Precision-Recall Curve**: Particularly useful for FilterNet's potentially imbalanced dataset.
4. **Classification Report**: Provides detailed precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
5. **Learning Curve**: Helps diagnose potential overfitting or underfitting in FilterNet.

## üìä Results
